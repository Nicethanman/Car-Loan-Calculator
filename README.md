# Car-Loan-Calculator
This program uses a similar car loaning calculation that many banks use today. The program will prompt the user with various information about the car they are planning to purchase and about their financial situation. This information includes:

- The cost of the car
- Loan term length
- Interest rate
- Down payment
- Credit score

CarLoanFrame.java contains the GUI that the user interacts with.
